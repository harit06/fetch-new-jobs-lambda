# fetch-new-jobs-lambda
This is a aws lambda function which fetches recently posted jobs. 

Hi, I am Hariharasudhan. 

# Birth of the Project 
Currently with the huge unemployment nation wide, People have to apply quick as soon as possible to stand out from the crowd. If you observe a role listed on LinkedIn for Software Engineer (University grad) the number of applications goes over 100 within minutes of posting. Hence to increase the probability of HR to view your profile it becomes essential that you submit a job application as quick as the job comes online. Additionally few of the companies post a job on their careers website first before going to linkedin to post the job. Hence to help myself and help other job seekers to land a legitimate and relevant job, I am developing a system to find most recent jobs posted today. 

Though i do have some understanding of how job markets works currently atleast in the field of Software Engineer i would love to hear, how this application could be improved to different domains. Please feel free to drop a message on ISSUES.

This project is solely intended to help the community and would not turn into business.
